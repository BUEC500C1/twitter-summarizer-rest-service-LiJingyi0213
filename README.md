## Main Goal
Make your HW4 a REST service running on AWS.

## Set up
1. Git clone repository
git clone https://github.com/BUEC500C1/twitter-summarizer-rest-service-lijingyi0213.git

2. Put your keys in keys file
```
consumer_key = ****
consumer_secret = ****
access_token = ****
access_secret = **** 
```
3. Run the program
```
pytest
```

## Steps
1. Use Flask as your WEB service platform
Reference 1:  https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/ (Github:  https://github.com/pallets/flask )
Reference 2:  Flask-RESTFUL  (Github:  https://github.com/flask-restful/flask-restful )

2. Step 2:  Integrate your module to become a RESTFUL system
Deploy your system to free AWS services:  https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc
Develop simple WEB applications to test your system.
Document your REST APIs on your Github
KEep your server off until we request it for grading.  We dont want you to waste money.
